		 <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
	     <p>I was born in Sarcelles. I have grown up in
            Choisy le roi. I was interested in Literature,
            so I obtained an A level in this domain. I
            decided to study communication. In 2015 I
            integrated the University Paris 8 where I’m
            specialized on audiovisual writing. After
            my diplomation, I decided to take a break
            of one year in order to reflect on my future
            and to progress in English. I worked as an
            education assistant. Recently I integrated
            a program provided by the University of
            Sorbonne Panthéon Assas. Currently, I am
            in IFP (French Press Institute) and at Essec.</p>
